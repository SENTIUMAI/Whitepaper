Sentium AI Whitepaper

Abstract

Sentium AI is a groundbreaking platform designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology for mental health evaluation. Built on the Solana blockchain, Sentium AI analyzes users' social media posts on X (formerly Twitter) to generate personalized insights into their emotional well-being. This document outlines the project's core features, objectives, methodologies, and future roadmap.

Introduction

Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, yet it remains an area underserved by traditional healthcare systems. The rise of social media has created an unprecedented opportunity to understand individuals' mental states through their online interactions. Sentium AI aims to fill this gap by providing a secure, AI-powered solution to assess emotional well-being while ensuring user privacy through blockchain technology.
